            <p>CSS uses rules, which dictate how a webpage is presented. Rules are indicated by using
                opening and closing curly braces {} and contain two parts.</p>
            <p>The two parts of a CSS rule are the selector and declaration.</p>
            <center><img src="RULE.png" alt="css rule" style="width:500px;height:150px"></center>
            <p>All declarations must end with a semicolon (;).</p>
            <p>Declarations also include properties, which indicate styling features and aspects, and 
                values, which indicate how the developer wants that feature or aspect.</p>
            <p>Selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements and add style.</p>
            <p>This can be done by;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Selecting HTML elements based on their element name. (Element selector)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Matching an element(s) whose class attributes has a value that matches. A period 
                    (.) must always be placed before the class of the element. (Class selector)
                </li>
                <li>
                    ID selectors use the id attribute to select specific items. A hashtag (#) wil be 
                placed before an element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Universal selectors use an asterisk (*) to target all HTML elements on the page. 
                <li>
                    Child selectors link elements that are the children of other elements, but not 
                    other elements on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Descendant selectors match the element that is a descendant of another specified 
                    element. A space between the elements denotes ancestor/descendant relationship.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>External stylesheets are the most preferred way of styling HTML documents with CSS. Each 
                rule is saved within a seperate stylesheet, which can be linked to the HTML pages by 
                using a &lt;link&gt; element.</p>
            <p>Internal stylesheets are very similar to an External stylesheet, the only differences 
                are that you have everything contained within a &lt;style&gt; element, which remains 
                within the &lt;head&gt;, and it also is contained within the HTML page you want 
                to affect. The internal method is best used when there is only one page of HTML.</p>
