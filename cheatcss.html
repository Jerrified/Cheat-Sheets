            <h2>Styling your HTML Documents</h2>
            <p>
                CSS uses rules, which dictate how a webpage is presented. Rules are indicated by using
                opening and closing curly braces {} and contain two parts.<br>
                The two parts of a CSS rule are the selector and declaration.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="RULE.png" alt="css rule" class="center" style="width:500px;height:150px">
            <p>
                All declarations must end with a semicolon (;).<br>
                Declarations also include properties, which indicate styling features and aspects, and 
                values, which indicate how the developer wants that feature or aspect.<br>
                Selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements and add style.<br>
            </p>
            <center class="border">This can be done by;
            <strong>
                Selecting HTML elements based on their element name. (Element selector)<br>
                Matching an element(s) whose class attributes has a value that matches. A period 
                (.) must always be placed before the class of the element. (Class selector)<br>
                ID selectors use the id attribute to select specific items. A hashtag (#) wil be 
                placed before an element.<br>
                Universal selectors use an asterisk (*) to target all HTML elements on the page.<br>
                Child selectors link elements that are the children of other elements, but not 
                other elements on the page.<br>
                Descendant selectors match the element that is a descendant of another specified 
                element. A space between the elements denotes ancestor/descendant relationship.<br>
            </strong></center>
            <p>External stylesheets are the most preferred way of styling HTML documents with CSS. Each 
                rule is saved within a seperate stylesheet, which can be linked to the HTML pages by 
                using a &lt;link&gt; element.<br>
            Internal stylesheets are very similar to an External stylesheet, the only differences 
                are that you have everything contained within a &lt;style&gt; element, which remains 
                within the &lt;head&gt;, and it also is contained within the HTML page you want 
                to affect. The internal method is best used when there is only one page of HTML.</p>
