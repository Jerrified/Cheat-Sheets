            <p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files 
            and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily 
            used for software development, but can be used to keep track of changes in any files.</p>
            <p>Git uses Respitories, which is the overall project.</p>
            <p>A branch is an extension of the respitory. All repositories start with a "master" 
                branch. From there new branches can be created and used for new features.</p>
            <p>A commit is a change to the repository. For every commit made, there is a 
                record of the state of the repository at that given point in time.</p>
            <p>The most common command in Git is 'cd' (change directory). which changes which 
                folder or directory your in.</p>
            <p>cd also has variants like cd ~, which moves you back to the home directory, cd .., 
                which moves you up one directory, and ls, which lists the folders and directories within 
                your current directory.</p>
            <p>There are numerous 'git' commands, including;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>git init, which creates a new repository in your current directory.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git clone, which clones a repository from another source. (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) 
                    It also places that new repository within whatever directory your in right now</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git checkout -b {branch name}, which creates and switches into another branch. 
                    git branch {branch name}, just creates a new branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git branch -a, displays all branches that are available, remote or local.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git status, probably the most important command, which tells you what files have been 
                    modified, deleted, or added. Informs us if the local branch is behind or ahead of the 
                    remote one.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git add {file, directory, or, other} stages the changes to be committed, and 
                    git branch . -- Stages all changes from the directory.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git commit -m”(commit message)” -- This commits the added changes locally and 
                    attaches the commit message to the commit. Commit messages should be short but 
                    descriptive of all the changes made. Committing does not push changes to the remote 
                    repository.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git push takes the locally committed changes for a given branch and applies them 
                    to the local version. git push -u origin {branch name} -- This command is used 
                    for pushing to the remote repository with the specific branch name.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>git pull takes the changes made to the remote repository and applies them to 
                    the local version.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>mkdir &lt;folder name&gt; makes folders, and rmdir &lt;folder name&gt; 
                    removes/deletes them.</p>
                        
                </li>
            </ul>
