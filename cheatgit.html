        <h2>Managing Your Files</h2>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and 
            coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for 
            software development, but can be used to keep track of changes in any files.<br>
            Git uses Respitories, which is the overall project.<br>
            A branch is an extension of the respitory. All repositories start with a "master" 
            branch. From there new branches can be created and used for new features.<br>
            A commit is a change to the repository. For every commit made, there is a record of 
            the state of the repository at that given point in time.<br>
            The most common command in Git is 'cd' (change directory). which changes which folder 
            or directory your in.<br>
            cd also has variants like cd ~, which moves you back to the home directory, cd .., 
            which moves you up one directory, and ls, which lists the folders and directories within 
            your current directory.<br>
        </p>
        <center class="border">There are numerous 'git' commands, including;
        <strong>
            git init, which creates a new repository in your current directory.<br>
            git clone, which clones a repository from another source. (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) 
            It also places that new repository within whatever directory your in right now.<br>
            git checkout -b {branch name}, which creates and switches into another branch. 
            git branch {branch name}, just creates a new branch. <br>
            git branch -a, displays all branches that are available, remote or local.<br>
            git status, probably the most important command, which tells you what files have been 
            modified, deleted, or added. Informs us if the local branch is behind or ahead of the 
            remote one.<br>
            git add {file, directory, or, other} stages the changes to be committed, and git branch 
            . -- Stages all changes from the directory.<br>
            git commit -m”(commit message)” -- This commits the added changes locally and attaches 
            the commit message to the commit. Commit messages should be short but descriptive of all 
            the changes made. Committing does not push changes to the remote repository.<br>
            git push takes the locally committed changes for a given branch and applies them to the 
            local version. git push -u origin {branch name} -- This command is used for pushing to 
            the remote repository with the specific branch name.<br>
            git pull takes the changes made to the remote repository and applies them to the local 
            version.<br>
            mkdir &lt;folder name&gt; makes folders, and rmdir &lt;folder name&gt; removes/deletes 
            them.
